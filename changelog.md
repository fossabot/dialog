### 1.0 ###

*Released on 2012-08-07*

- This is the first version of the code, which includes the 3 objects `dialogSettings`, `dialog()` and `returnObj`.
- The code integrates the default stylesheet. The semitransparent background of the dialog doesn't work with IE less than 9.
- When pressing enter on the keyboard the script will emulate the ok or continue button click, and the esc key will emulate the cancel button click if the cancel button is shown.

- Fixed a problem with the xhtml syntax. Now the function works good both in html and xhtml, automatically.
